# Stone-Paper-Scissor


Create a simple web-based game where a user can play Stone-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The game should have a basic UI to show the options, display the results, and track the score.

## Components
HTML: Structure the game interface with buttons for each option (stone, paper, scissors), a display for the results, and a score tracker.

CSS: Style the game to make it visually appealing.

JavaScript: Implement the game logic, including handling user input, generating computer choices, determining the winner, and updating the score.
